### Deep check after the department split (no code change)
- 17 of 19 checks pass at 0.01 L (planted 0.02 L errors caught). Calendar department snapshots = totals (0.000000 L); AOP live = V2; BIS, Sales Plan, Attribute Master (DB = file, 978) and Listing / Delisting Analyser all on the new department names; 13 test suites pass.
- After BIS was opened at 12:07 it pushed the new names to Sales Plan (792 rows, AOP 112). Sales Plan now applies exactly AOP's growth (to 0.0003 pp); its SSG plan meets the AOP target within 0.05 L in Mar–May'27 and 0.92–1.16 L in Jun'27.
- The remaining difference is entirely V2's saved LY base vs today's Calendar data (Mar–May ≤ 0.045 L, likely V2's 2-decimal store rows; Jun'27 = the ODISHA calendar re-save). A new AOP version made live would bring both to zero.

### Split departments adopted across the suite — `7c0a1e2` (core), `f682b5d` (additional apps + rename), `4040f68` (attribute master DB)
The data lake's 5 Sep export re-classified six departments back to 2019; the parts add up exactly to the old department (store × month) and division totals are unchanged.

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| MSE_PYJAMA | MSE_HSR PYJAMA, MSE_TXTL PYJAMA |
| KB_T-SHIRT H/S | KB_R/N T-SHIRT H/S, KB_POLO T-SHIRT H/S |
| KB_BERMUDA | KB_HSR BERMUDA, KB_TXTL BERMUDA |
| LW_L_PALAZZO | LW_L_WES PALAZZO, LW_L_ETH PALAZZO |
| LW_L_JEGGING | LW_L_DNM JOGGER, LW_L_WVN JOGGER |
| L_IN_BRA | L_IN_BRA (smaller), L_IN_SPRT BRA |

- **BIS:** new sections (season inherited, FY26 LY split exactly), sales file re-pinned to the 5 Sep export so LY, 19 V 26 / 25 V 26 history and sell-through come from the new names. A saved plan or version on the old names hands each old department's growth, AOP seed, lock and hide state to its parts once, then saves so Sales Plan switches too. Division LY unchanged (388.87 Cr). Check: `node test_dept_split.js`.
- **Sales Plan:** master list on the new names with the right season (the auto-registered REGULAR copies removed); MRP plan split and department active states carried to the parts.
- **Attribute Master (`att master.xlsx`):** the 9 missing new departments added with their old department's section and season, the 5 old names removed (978 rows, one per department; ~618k empty formatted rows dropped).
- **Attribute Master in the database (`masterdata.attribute_master`):** loaded on the user's go-ahead. The table did not exist before — Sales Plan's attribute correction had been falling back to the Excel file — so the loader created it with the 978 rows and no old rows existed to delete. Sales Plan now reads the table (same content). `test_attribute_master.py` expects 978 in both.
- **Listing / Delisting Analyser** (renamed from "Listing / Delisting" on Landing, in the app and in the Re-Aligner): listing history hands each old department's flags to its parts for the months before the listing sheets switched names (Jan'26); the day-wise cache splits an old department's days by that store's month split from the month-wise export (exact per store × month) until a day-wise export with the new names lands. Sales, seasonality and suggestions rebuilt.
- **Verified:** BIS shows the new departments with LY, both history growths and sell-through, and no old names; a saved plan's migration gives each part its old department's exact growth and AOP seed. Listing's split day-wise sales equal the month-wise export in every store × month Jan'24–Jul'26 (max 0.002 L); listing history, sales, seasonality, windows and suggestions carry only the new names (the old ones appear only in the cache's split trace). Suggestions rebuilt: 338 delist, 155 relist.
- **Re-Aligner:** its plan already uses the new names; it reads the rebuilt Listing files and the updated Attribute Master.
- **NSO Distributor:** no names of its own — it uses the uploaded Sales Plan export (new names) and Attribute Master (upload the updated one).

### BIS: smoother section / attribute lock — `7042878`
- One padlock drawing for both states (was a text "○" swapping to a 🔒 emoji of a different size, so the cell jumped). The shackle drops when locked and lifts when unlocked, with a short pop; the growth input tints amber while locked. Animations play even though the table re-draws on each toggle, and are off for reduced-motion users. The button is keyboard-operable and keeps focus after the re-draw.

### Sales Plan uses AOP's 148-store LFL rule for SSG — `9f827f4`
- **Before:** Sales Plan's SSG stores = tag ends with "- Stores" + an ANG override = **121** stores, so its SSG totals could never equal AOP (KIDS Apr'27 ₹2,575 L vs ₹3,108 L).
- **Now:** `store_master.is_ssg` calls AOP's own `engine_v3.auto_tag` (trading store, opened by 31 Dec before the LY window) = **148** stores, the same set AOP and BIS plan on. The 27 added stores are the FY26 Q1–Q3 openings (Mar–Oct 2025); none dropped. ANG override removed (already inside the 148).
- **Check:** SSG LY = AOP base within 0.04 L for Mar–May'27 (e.g. KIDS Apr'27 2,825.51 vs 2,825.49 L); Jun'27 is ~1 L off per division (the known V2 ODISHA Jun'27 calendar difference). Every department with BIS growth plans at exactly +10.0% in Apr–Jun, as in AOP. Missing ref stores 134 → 106.
- **Still short of AOP TY by ~1–1.5%:** departments the data lake names differently from BIS get no growth (e.g. KB_R/N T-SHIRT H/S vs BIS KB_T-SHIRT H/S, MSE_HSR/TXTL PYJAMA vs MSE_PYJAMA, LW_L_WES/ETH PALAZZO vs LW_L_PALAZZO) — needs a department mapping decision.

### BIS: history hover not showing — `0b6f95e`
- **Problem:** the 19 V 26 / 25 V 26 hover and header store counts stayed blank in a browser that had opened BIS before `267d1d6`. BIS keeps the history in the browser (`ck_lfl_growth`) and only re-fetched it when the server's data version changed, so the old copy (no store counts, no ₹ values) was kept.
- **Fix:** a saved copy without store counts is treated as out of date and re-synced on open. Verified by planting an old copy and reloading: headers show "19 V 26 · 31 st" / "25 V 26 · 101–120 st", cells show the per-month ₹ Cr and period total.

### Sales Plan reads LY sales from the Calendar; Buyer's Input drives department status — `267d1d6`
- **Department Master:** "Sync from AOP Forecaster" is now **"Sync from Buyer's Input"**. KIDS / LADIES / MENS departments are active when live BIS plans them (96 / 57 / 39), inactive otherwise; GM / RETAIL are left as set. The AOP division-target loader stays as a small "Load AOP division targets" link.
- **Growth Matrix:** inactive departments are greyed, tagged INACTIVE and read-only; column fill skips them.
- **Sales Sync page:** the manual "Sync Sales" button and the Excel import (MAMJ'26, month locks, admin unlock) are removed. The page is read-only and shows the last nightly sync and the new department-level tables.
- **Sales Plan actuals:** store × department LY sales now come from the Calendar's department snapshots, refreshed nightly by `sync/calendar_reindex_sync.py` — **reindexed sales = plan base**, actual sales alongside. New snapshot kinds `actual_dept` / `trend_shifted_dept` (migration `d9f3b2a7c1e5`). They sum exactly to the existing month-wise snapshots (0.000000 L over 20,569 cells). First full plan built: 425 stores, Mar–Aug'27.
- 29 departments with sales but missing from Sales Plan's department list were auto-registered (incl. ₹36.5 Cr MENS pyjamas).
- **BIS 19 V 26 / 25 V 26:** header shows the like-for-like store count (per-month counts on hover); cell hover shows both years' ₹ Cr per month, store count and period total.

## 2026-09-26 — Planning-chain audit fixes — `5f551d7`

Audit tolerance 0.01 L per cell and total; every check also had to catch a planted 0.02 L error. Live AOP = Version 2 (publish 112).

**BIS**
- AOP growth is kept unrounded (was 2 dp → up to 0.15 L/cell off target); display stays 2 dp. Re-balancing no longer re-rounds.
- Seeding uses the LY of **active** departments only (hidden departments had left divisions up to 528.82 L short).
- Reopening keeps the buyer's edits: BIS re-seeds only when the AOP version changes (locked cells kept); "Re-seed plan" is the full reset.
- Pushes to Sales Plan only months BIS actually records, only once AOP is applied, stamped with the AOP publish id; a failed push is shown to the user. One push per AOP apply (was two).

**Calendar**
- Cluster names are case-insensitive: the last-saved spelling wins across all cluster tables (`adopt_cluster_spelling`); "Kashmir" → "KASHMIR".
- Month-cache key now includes the store → cluster map, so a renamed cluster isn't served stale months.

**AOP Forecaster**
- Review grid: fixed column widths, plain "All months" column, month selector; Results follow the same month pick.
- Store rows kept at 4 dp; "Base Calendar" label shows both calendar ids.
- Reindexed-base preview counts DND / CDIT / CONSIGNMENT in the division shares.
- **Lock to Planning:** locking a deleted / unsaved version now refuses with a message (it used to silently lock the latest saved version).

**Sales Plan**
- Plan engines read the live BIS growth on P1/P2 (months BIS doesn't record are hidden); GM / RETAIL stay editable.
- Division Plan: AOP months land exactly on the AOP target; fixed the Apr–Mar plan running Jul–Jun; Export CSV exports the plan on screen.

**Landing**
- Added the missing `/api/config/buyer-department-growth` route, so BIS growth reaches Sales Plan through the shared address.

### Known open items (reported, awaiting a decision)
- ~~Sales Plan SSG uses 121 stores~~ — fixed 28 Sep (`9f827f4`, 148 stores).
- NON FOOD: Sales Plan files it under RETAIL, AOP under GM.
- MRP Re-apportionment page returns 404.
- V2's Mar'27 base is not festival-shifted (141 L, accepted); 38 KLM departments have no BIS growth.
